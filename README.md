## About
Gym Bag was created as part of an effort to build new stuff every week. This was
the third app in the series, which builds off of an early version of the Heart Rate
calculator I completed earlier.

The main goals for this project were to:
1. Continue to gain familiarity with svelte
2. Implement svelte router for multiple pages
3. Get more comfortable with Bulma customization

### Tech Stack
1. Svelete
2. Bulma
3. Fontawesome
